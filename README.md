# ticTacToe

A simple tic tac toe app, to illustrate the use of MVC, MVP, and MVVM architectures to organize the application.

The master branch contains just the model - The brains & state of the tic tac toe game.

Other branches contain the model, plus a User Interface following:
* *mvc* - Is an example of using Model View Controller to model the UI / Model Interaction.
* *mvp* - Example of Model View Presenter
* *mvvm* - Example of Model View ViewModel with Databinding 

#### Notes
* This project is the companion project to a post I authored at https://academy.realm.io/posts/eric-maxwell-mvc-mvp-and-mvvm-on-android/.  
* It is intended to be a reference to show the concepts of MVC, MVVM, and MVP on Android.  

* This post and project was created before the GoogleIO 2017 announcment of Android [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html) and the [Android Architecture Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOJCrbr144o), which changes the way we think about ViewModels in the Android Lifecycle.

* Finally, there are several additional things I would do to these example if I were releasing this Tic Tac Toe app to production, including providing a landscape UI and handling rotation, an app icon, more tests, etc.   My goal in this project is to illustrate the concepts of MVC, MVP and MVVM in a simple consice manner.  

**I hope this project/post is useful to you!   Thank you for reading.**
